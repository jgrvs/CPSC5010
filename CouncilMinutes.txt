DATE DEPARTMENT DESCRIPTION COST SUPPLIER DOCUMENT
12/19/23 Mayor's Office Homeless
Support $500,000.00 Chatt Regional
Homeless Coalition Documentation
EXPLANATION:
Due to the depletion during the coldest months of the year as well as the number of outstanding
referrals from various agencies received by OHSH, an emergency purchase is being utilized to
ensure individuals experiencing homelessness in the Chattanooga community can be moved into
permanent housing as quickly as possible. As it continues to get colder, unsheltered individuals -
including many families with children - are at an increased risk for experiencing negative long-term
health outcomes and other adverse experiences.
