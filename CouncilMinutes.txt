A hearing ensued [view here], but no members of the Opposition spoke.

After which, Ms. Rennich gave a presentation on the case. She noted that there was no
opposition at the Planning Commission; yet, she did receive one email in opposition.
Councilwoman Noel informed the Council that she had met with Mr. McDaniel at the
neighborhood association meeting, but he could not tell his plans for the property. Therefore,
Councilwoman Noel moved to deny. Councilwoman Berz seconded.
Discussion ensued. Councilwoman Coonrod expressed support from District 9 for Mr. McDaniel’s
project. Councilman Smith recommended deferring this case until Mr. McDaniel could bring a
plan. Chair Dotley voiced concerns about past problems at this location. Councilwoman Noel
informed the Council of Mr. McDaniel’s plans to sale the property.
Councilwoman Berz offered to withdraw her second to the main motion if Mr. McDaniel wished to
withdraw his case. Further discussion ensued. Mr. McDaniel asked the Council to withdraw.
Councilwoman Berz withdrew her second. Chair Dotley ruled that the motion failed due to the lack
of a second. Councilwoman Noel moved to withdraw. Councilman Smith seconded. The motion
carried.
